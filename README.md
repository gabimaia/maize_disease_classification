# maize_disease_classification
A Machine Learning model applied for maize disease classification

## Maize_disease_classification
This repository contains the second project of the Machine Learning discipline guided by Prof. Dr. Ivanovitch Medeiros (at UFRN)

The main purposes of this project is using a fastAPI to deploy a predict model for heart disease, based on "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset" kaggle

The objective of the project is to carry out and implement a model capable of a Neural Network capable of predicting the conditions of maize leaves.

For this we will use WandB + TensorFlow+ FastAPI + Heroku.

Students: Jord√£o Silva and Gabriel Maia
